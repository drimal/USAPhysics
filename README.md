# About the project. 
This project was a part of an analysis to asses the efficiacy of a Supplemental Instruction program in one participating university. Supplemental instruction (SI) is a group based teaching/learning method designed for students to succeed and retain material taught in perceived difficult subjects. In this method, each group is assigned an SI leader who has already completed the course. The SI leader attends lecture classes, takes notes, and solves problems with students. The students meet in SI sessions twice a week outside of the lecture where they review matter covered in the class, discuss among themselves, and work as a group to solve problems under the facilitation of the SI leader. Reports from supplemental instruction in physics and other classes at one participating university dated. To assess the efficacy of the SI program, we analyzed data collected by a post completion survery of the students enrolled in both algebra and calculus-based physics at the end of each semester until the fall of 2017. We studied the impact of SI sessions on studentsâ€™ GPA, letter grades, numbers of withdrawal/incompletion, and compared students who attended SI sessions versus those who did not attend. Further, we discuss the influence on overall retention of students enrolled in physics classes at the end of each semester.
